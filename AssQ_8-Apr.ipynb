    "When developing an SVM (Support Vector Machine) regression model for house price prediction or any regression task, it's important to choose appropriate regression metrics to evaluate the model's performance. Here are some commonly used regression metrics that would be suitable for evaluating your SVM regression model for house price prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE):\n",
    "MAE calculates the average absolute differences between the predicted values and the actual values. It provides a simple and interpretable measure of the average prediction error in the same units as the target variable (house prices in this case). MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to some other metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
    "MSE is one of the most common regression metrics. It calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted values and actual values. Squaring the errors gives more weight to larger errors, which can make it sensitive to outliers. However, since you're dealing with house price prediction, outliers might be present, making MSE worth considering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n",
    "RMSE is the square root of the MSE. It provides a metric in the same units as the target variable, which can be easily interpreted. Like MSE, RMSE is sensitive to outliers but penalizes larger errors more heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared (Coefficient of Determination):\n",
    "R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (house prices) that is predictable from the independent variables (characteristics like location, square footage, etc.). It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better model fit. However, R-squared can be misleading when used alone, especially if the model is complex or overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Percentage Error (MPE) or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):\n",
    "These metrics calculate the average percentage difference between predicted and actual values. They provide insights into the percentage error in predictions, which can be useful for understanding the relative magnitude of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Huber Loss:\n",
    "Huber Loss is a hybrid loss function that combines the advantages of both MAE and MSE. It is less sensitive to outliers than MSE and provides a smooth transition between the two loss functions. Using the Huber Loss as a custom loss function in SVM regression could be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantile Loss (Quantile Regression):\n",
    "If you're interested in predicting house prices with different quantiles (e.g., median, 10th percentile, 90th percentile), then quantile loss or quantile regression can be appropriate. This allows you to model the conditional distribution of house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the best metric depends on the specific goals of your house price prediction task, the characteristics of your dataset, and your tolerance for different types of prediction errors. It's often a good idea to use a combination of these metrics to get a comprehensive understanding of your SVM regression model's performance."

Since your goal is accurate prediction of house prices, using MSE as the evaluation metric would directly penalize larger errors more heavily. In the context of house price prediction, where you want to minimize the discrepancy between predicted prices and actual prices, MSE aligns well with your objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, R-squared (Coefficient of Determination) measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (house prices) that is explained by the independent variables (features).

    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE calculates the average absolute differences between predicted values and actual values. MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to Mean Squared Error (MSE) because it doesn't square the errors. This makes MAE a suitable choice when outliers are present, as outliers can have a disproportionate impact on the squared errors in MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Huber Loss: Huber Loss is a hybrid loss function that combines the characteristics of both MAE and MSE. It behaves like MSE for smaller errors and like MAE for larger errors.

Using Huber Loss as a custom loss function in your SVM regression model could help balance the impact of outliers on the model's performance.\n",

Both MAE and Huber Loss are designed to handle outliers better than pure MSE or other metrics like R-squared. It's a good practice to experiment with different metrics and assess how well your model performs in the presence of outliers to make an informed decision."
